## 🌐 About the Project  

**NMSimple** is a lightweight yet powerful **network switch management and backup tool**, designed and deployed during my internship at **BHEL (Central Design & Technology department)**.  

It automates the **manual, time-consuming process of switch configuration backups**, adds **real-time monitoring capabilities**, and replaces costly licensed tools with a free, in-house alternative.  

✨ Today, NMSimple is actively used at BHEL to:  
- Save IT teams **hours of manual work**  
- Cut down on **recurring licensing costs**  
- Ensure **secure, reliable, and automated backups**  

## 🔑 Features  

- 🖧 **Device Management** – Add, edit, delete, and monitor switches  
- 🔒 **Secure Backups** – SSH-based config retrieval & automated scheduling  
- ⏰ **Backup Scheduler** – Automated backups with version history  
- 📊 **Real-Time Monitoring** – SNMP-based monitoring with CPU, VLAN & traffic analysis  
- 💾 **Local Database** – Secure, lightweight SQLite integration  
- 🎨 **Modern GUI** – Dark-theme PySide6 interface with responsive layout  
- 🔔 **Notifications & Logs** – Toast alerts and event history for transparency  

## 🏆 Achievements & Impact  

- 💰 **Cost Savings** – Replaced licensed Motadata tool (saved recurring costs)  
- ⏳ **Time Efficiency** – Reduced manual backup time from *hours* to *minutes*  
- 🔐 **Reliability** – Automated scheduling prevents config loss  
- 🙌 **Adoption** – Successfully deployed & used in BHEL production environment  
- ⭐ **Recognition** – Received outstanding feedback from IT supervisors & team  

## 🔮 Future Enhancements  

- 🌍 **Multi-vendor Support** – Compatibility for more switch manufacturers  
- ☁️ **Cloud Integration** – Remote monitoring & backup  
- 📱 **Mobile Companion App** – Monitor devices on the go  
- 📊 **Advanced Analytics** – Network performance trend analysis  
- 🔑 **Role-Based Access Control** – User permissions & security layers  
- 🔌 **REST API** – Third-party integrations  

## 🛠 Tech Stack  

- **Language:** Python  
- **GUI Framework:** PySide6 (Qt)  
- **Database:** SQLite  
- **Protocols:** SNMP, SSH
